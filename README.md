# Effective Elegy

![](https://github.com/anttikivi/effective-elegy/workflows/Main%20workflow/badge.svg)

Effective Elegy is the licence of [Obliging Ode](https://github.com/anttikivi/unsung-anthem) and [Unsung Anthem](https://github.com/anttikivi/unsung-anthem). Its main design goal is to be simple while enabling proprietary use. It makes it possible to have the source code of a program freely available while not open source.

## Install

The released versions of Effective Elegy are available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/anttikivi/effective-elegy/releases). Each release contains the licence as a downloadable text file.

### Build

To build Effective Elegy, you need to be able to use POSIX shell scripts.

First, clone the GitHub repository of Effective Elegy.

**Via HTTPS:** If you’re checking out sources as read-only, HTTPS works best.

    git clone https://github.com/anttikivi/effective-elegy.git

**Via SSH:** If you’re planning on regularly making direct commits, cloning over SSH may provide a better experience (it requires [uploading SSH keys to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/))

    git clone git@github.com:anttikivi/effective-elegy.git

After cloning the source, make sure to change to the cloned directory.

    cd effective-elegy

Then run the build script of Effective Elegy.

    ./util/build

That’s it; you’ll find the built text file in the `dist` directory.
